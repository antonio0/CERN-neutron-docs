Four private, secondary IP services were requested in order to connect VMs to the CERN network.

| Service Name | CIDR | Cluster Name |
| -- | -- | -- |
| S513-C-VM972 | 10.34.6.0/24 | NeutronPool S513-C-IP186 |
| S513-C-VM969 | 10.34.7.0/24 | NeutronPool S513-C-IP186 |
| S513-C-VM974 | 10.34.3.0/24 | NeutronPool S513-C-IP184 |
| S513-C-VM973 | 10.34.5.0/24 | NeutronPool S513-C-IP185 |

Each one of these IP service is mapped in Neutron as a subnet.

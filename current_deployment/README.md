# Current deployment

This section contains an overview of the resources used to build CERN's first integrated Neutron test cluster.

Previous investigations were carried out on a testbed of machines with most Neutron features enabled. However, it is not be currenly possible to integrate such configuration within CERN's environment. A report about the various issues that prevent most Neutron L3 functionalities to be deployed is available [here](https://github.com/JoeHazzers/neutron-doc-cern).

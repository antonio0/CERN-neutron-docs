# Implementation
This section explains the difficulties of deploying OpenStack Neutron within CERN's computer centres and provides a detailed explanation of the solutions that have been implemented in order to overcome those issues.

The actual code implementation can be found in this forked GitHub [repository](https://github.com/cernops/neutron/tree/cern-juno-patches).
